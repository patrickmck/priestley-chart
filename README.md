# A New *New Chart of History*

One of my favourite data visualisations was made towards the end of the 18th century, when British polymath Joseph Priestley published his *[Chart of Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chart_of_Biography)* and a *[New Chart of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Chart_of_History)*. These charts mapped the lives of people and empires, respectively, in two dimensions: time on the horizontal and space on the vertical.
